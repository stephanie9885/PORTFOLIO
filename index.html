    <h2>ü§ù Philanthropic Endeavors</h2>
    <p>
      I am passionate about giving back to my community, and my philanthropic endeavors reflect my commitment to helping others. I‚Äôve had the privilege of mentoring young survivors of trauma, working as president of a children‚Äôs survivor group, No Touch Zone. Through art therapy and crisis education, I‚Äôve provided guidance and support to those in need.

      In addition, I‚Äôve traveled across the Houston metroplex to teach high school students about sexual health, empowering them with the knowledge and resources to make informed decisions. I believe in creating tailored solutions for each individual, and I apply this principle to all of my community work, whether it‚Äôs through educational outreach or one-on-one support.
