    <h2>ü§ù Philanthropic Endeavors</h2>
    <p>
      Giving back is core to who I am. As president of a children‚Äôs survivor support group, <em>No Touch Zone</em>, I facilitated healing through art therapy and educational outreach. My work supported young survivors as they rebuilt trust and self-expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also led sex education workshops across the Houston metroplex, helping high school students understand their bodies, boundaries, and choices. Empowerment through knowledge is something I deeply believe in‚Äîand apply both in my community and my career.
